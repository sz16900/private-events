# private-events

This site is similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and send invitations and parties. Events take place at a specific date and at a location (which you can just store as a string, like “Andy’s House”).
Written in Ruby in partial fulfillment of the Microverse Curriculum.
